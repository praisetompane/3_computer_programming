# 3_Programming
# Definitions
* objective => unpack what computer programming is and its role in the implementation of computation.
* Imperative programming => is a paradigm in which the programmer stipulates to the computer the steps it should take to achieve an objective.
* Functional programming => is a paradigm in which the programmer stipulate only the objective and lets the computer igure out the best way to achieve it.
