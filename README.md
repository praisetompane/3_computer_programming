#### definitions
* objective => unpack what computer programming is and its role in the implementation of computation

* Imperative programming => is a paradigm in which the programmer stipulates to the computer the steps it should take to achieve an objective 

* Functional programming => is a paradigm in which the programmer stipulate only the objective to ge computer and itâ€™s left to figure out the best way to achieve the objective

#### Rough View of the applicatios of programming
* Client Facing:
    Web - Mobile first philosophy
    iOS
        Swift
        Objective C
        ComponentKit
    Android
        Java

    Server side rendered 
    Desktop
* Middle Tier: Internal scripts, system checks/administration, tests, tools, deployment, automation etc
    * Python
    * Go
* Backend: APIs for client facing layer. Glue code to read/receive data
