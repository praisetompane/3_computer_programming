# 3_Programming
# Definitions
* objective => unpack what computer programming is and its role in the implementation of computation
* Imperative programming => is a paradigm in which the programmer stipulates to the computer the steps it should take to achieve an objective 
* Functional programming => is a paradigm in which the programmer stipulate only the objective to ge computer and itâ€™s left to figure out the best way to achieve the objective
