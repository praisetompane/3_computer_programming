Can think of them these models as?

What can you offer me, what's your solution?:
* We can do things => Declarative

There is a lot of things to do, what's your solution?:
* We can do these things at the same toime => Concurrent Declarative

There is too much going on from doing things at the same time, to finish all the things we need to do, 
thus WE are running out of resources, What is your solution?:
* We want to do these things at the same time ONLY when we need to => Lazy declarative

We are doing lots of things at the same time, but we forget after we are done, thus have have to redo them when we need them, 
WE are running out of resources, What is your solution?
* We want to do these things at the same time ONLY when we need to ans save the result of our work => Stateful 

We are doing lots of things at the same time and saving our results everywhere and stepping over each otherm it is a mess!
What is your solution?
* We want to do these things at the same time ONLY when we need to ans save the result of our work in an organised way separate from each other => Object Orientated

We are doing lots of things at the same time and saving our results in an organised way separate from each other,
but there is some resource we HAVE to share[read and write to].
What is your solution?
* Shared_State_Concurrent
